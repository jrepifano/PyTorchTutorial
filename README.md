# PyTorch Tutorial
This repository provides some basic boilerplate code for PyTorch and PyTorch-Lightning.

To install the required packages please clone the repository and run the following command inside the directory:\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Included Files
- linear_lighting.py, conv_lighting.py: Includes code to train and evaluate MNIST using linear and convolutional neural networks
- linear_vanilla.py: train and test an MNIST model in vanilla PyTorch
- linear_vanilla_no_dataloader.py: train and test a random classification problem in PyTorch without using dataloaders
